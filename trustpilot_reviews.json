I just checked my bank statement and I  have been charged around £90 per month for not using the account. £10 for the useless machine rental and £75 for non-compliance fee. I phoned them to request to cancel the account and I was told I need to do this in writing and they will charge £75 for restocking the useless card machine. I will never use this company again. I do not recommend this company to anyone. The online dashboard is outdated. Their monthly statement does not simply show how much you are being charged.  Outdated card machine, outdated dashboard,  inefficient complaints requirement, huge, surprising fees, and a penalty for closing the account.  there are many companies that do not do any of these. \n\nI have used a different company in the past. There are no extra fees for the card machine, no compliance requirement or theft of £75 per month for not filing the compliance form, and a great online user interface. ",

After I made a clear request two months ago to cancel my card terminal, they completely ignored it. I was charged a shocking £300 for two months of a service I specifically asked them to cancel. Now, after countless attempts to get them to fix this, I’m STILL stuck in the middle of a cancellation process that is dragging on with zero communication from their customer support.\n\nTheir customer service is non-existent. Every time I’ve reached out, I’ve been met with either a complete lack of response or irrelevant, generic answers that don’t solve a thing. The level of incompetence and total disregard for their customers is beyond belief.\n\nI’ve now been forced to jump through hoops for weeks just to get my account canceled, and they continue to charge me. This is nothing short of theft. Avoid this company at all costs—there are far better options out there. Their support is a nightmare, their billing practices are unethical, and they do not care about resolving issues.\n\nIf I could give 0 stars, I would.",

Bhav took the time to thoroughly review our account, answer all my questions, and provide clear and helpful advice tailored to our needs.\n\nThe personal service was outstanding—friendly, professional, and efficient. It's rare to come across such genuine customer care these days, and Bhav went above and beyond to ensure everything was explained in detail and that we were completely satisfied.\n\nHighly recommend Bhav and the Global Payments team for their excellent support and commitment to their customers. Thank you for making the process so seamless and stress-free!",

        "text": "I've been a customer of Global Payments for probably a few decades (via HSBC) and have always been very happy with the service I've received so it is with a degree of regret that I find myself needing to resort to Trust Pilot, in order to get my message across to the team at Global Payments UK. I should start by saying that this isn't 1 star review, because I have just spoken to an incredibly helpful, professional and courteous customer service advisor about my issue. But my issue goes beyond what they were able to help with, so it's a 2 star in the hope that my message will still get noticed. Here goes..\n\nWhat on earth is Global Payments doing, by partnering up with a company which is essentially a loan shark, such as Liberis.com !? I received an email from Global Payments offering a \"funding solution\" which basically involves receiving a loan which is repaid by deductions from your card payment takings. Sounds convenient and a great facility to take advantage of.\n\nOnly, upon getting a quote and doing my own calculations, the interest rate works out at approximately 125% per annum! Is this even legal!? What makes it particularly scandalous in my mind is that the interest rate is not actually disclosed because the facility is never referred to as a \"loan\" but rather an \"alternative funding solution\". I guess this is how they can get away with it. You would never know what interest rate you were effectively paying unless you worked it out. Extraordinary!\n\nSo funding (ie a loan) of £3000 would cost over £1000 in interest, paid back over just 4 months. This sounds very similar to the practices that were taken advantage of by the Payday Loan industry some years ago that I understand was finally clamped down on by the FCA. I guess the same protections don't exist for businesses, that exist for individuals.\n\nMy big concern though is that it is being championed by the well respected brand that is Global Payments. If I had received the email from Liberis (who I'd never heard of) I would have been more skeptical and not been suprised that it was a very bad deal, but because the email actually came from Global Payments and not Liberis (the customer service advisor I spoke to was able to confirm that the email from Global Payments was legitimate), I trusted the offer.\n\nThis experience has entirely undermined and sullied my trust in Global Payments. I never imagined that they would contact me to endorse a product which is so clearly in my mind, a rort.\n\nIf you receive any communication from Global Payments regarding Liberis, BEWARE! They are out to trick you. After choosing not to proceed with the application, I then received multiple follow up calls and emails from Liberis, trying to negotiate a better deal which was still over 95% pa in interest.\n\nI hope that Global Payments will see the damage that this partnership with Liberis is doing to their brand and rescind it asap.",

That sounded great, they explained the driver will collect the old one and replace it with a new one. Fantastic I thought. What a dream. These criminal refused to release all my taking at my small business. Guess why? They said I have not been paying for the terminal they collected from my establishment I month earlier. I was confused, what do mean I have been paying. I have Global set up on a DIRECT DEBIT. They said yes, but I also have to have to pay for the terminal they collected. Apparently I am still using the terminal they collected from me a month earlier. So the result was I had to pay £117 so credit control held £0,000s of because of. As a small business that has not made any profit we rely on weekly takings to pay staff, bills, rent and bug produce. So this company decided that despite the fact they took the terminal from us and provided a replacement. I am supposed to call them back to cancel the terminal they collected. People this is not fantasy, it is a true story. RUN FAR AWAY FROM GLOBAL PAYMENTS, YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY. ",

It has been a 3 month headache and finally we decided to go back to our original Ingenico terminals as the new ones are just terrible. Our contact Stephen Lovie has been the only consistent thing throughout this, always contactable and happy to help where he can. Stephen has just gone round all 5 of our venues and personally swapped all the terminals back to the original design for us since we've had such a nightmare already.

        "text": "On a change from the old VISA machines to new Android ones, we were sent 2 machines. We only needed one, so stored the 2nd away. After a week of putting transactions through the new terminal we didn't get any payments. Looking at the receipts to take a photo for a record, and to send them, we noticed that the header was that of another company. The terminal had been sent to us by mistake, and the sales had gone to the company listed as the terminal owner. Complaining about it produced no resolution except for them to collect the wrong terminal. I got a reference number for the complaint and a promise that they would call me back, but have never done so. All calls seem to end up in India and speaking to them, apart from difficulties in understanding them, only produces promises that a senior supervisor would call me back. They never do.\nPersonally I believe there are better systems out there and I'm currently looking to cancel my contract with Global Payments.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n25/10/23\nFollowing this review I was contacted by someone, I believe who calls himself Rod, where my complaint was escalated to. I was promised that the payments sent to another company would be put back into my account by Friday 20/10/23, then come Friday I got another call saying it would be Monday or Tuesday. It's now Wednesday 25/10/23, and yeah - no fulfilment of that promise as expected. In the meantime I had a payment taken for monthly charges even though the use of the terminal was largely denied by my having the wrong terminal. I was also promised that this monthly charge would be reversed. I hate to say it BUT that promise has also failed to materialise.\nI won't accept any more verbal promises. Only the return of the misplaced payments and the return of the monthly charge paid into my bank account TODAY will be taken as goodwill. How they do it, is down to them but they have my bank account details, they know how much went missing, and how much the last month's charges were. \nI was also promised another 3 months waiver of charges but after all this failure to act properly I now say that the 3 months should be upped to 6 months.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n26/10/23\nMonday, Tuesday went by with no result. Wednesday only got a sorry about the problem in the comments, and here we are on Thursday still being frustrated in having this sorted out. \nIt's become a sort of pointer as to what other Global Payment potential customers can expect.\nMoney into my bank account TODAY G.P. or I'll keep updating this review on a daily basis. OR DON'T YOU CARE?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n27/10/23\nWell, my posting back here sort of answers my question, doesn't it. They don't seem to give a hit.\nI've now cancelled my Direct Debit.\nLet's see if that encourages a response\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n29/10/23\nI see a payment has now gone into my bank, however it's not exactly the right amount. It's £4.26 short. As well as that I was also promised a return of last months fees of £42.44, as I have been denied the use of my terminal for most of that period due them sending the wrong one.\nYou're nearly there, Global Payments, but not quite.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n4/11/23\nSurprise, surprise. Despite the promises of no account charges for 3 months, and a return of the last month's fees, nothing has been received back as yet. \nToday I had another invoice notification for charges for the period to end of October.\nThis is really beyond a joke.\nC'mon Global Payments. What in God's name are you doing????\nP.S. I will edit this post for every new problem encountered, or promise that remains unfulfilled until such time as absolutely everything is sorted out to my satisfaction.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n9/12/2023\nI received a monthly charges invoice despite them telling me that the next 3 months would be free. I had already cancelled the direct debit as I suspected this would happen, so they couldn't take payment from my bank.\nHowever they paid over an amount equal to a sale amount less the monthly charge fee. It's only £30 but every penny counts, eh? So they have reneged on the promise of 3 months free charges.\nThis company is the absolute pits.\n-----------------------------------------\n17/12/2023\n\"Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. I'm sorry to hear that your experience hasn't been as we'd have hoped. I have reached out to the Resolutions Team to look into this for you. Kind regards Dawn\"\nThe Resolutions Team must be on Xmas holiday. This is my last post: I am cancelling my contract for breach of trust  ",

(After a day, I was able to connect without even needing wifi) Then I made the first payment process successfully, but I noticed that the battery of the device was halved even though I fully charged the device the night before. was not happening.\nBy the way, I discovered through my own efforts that when the device goes into sleep mode after a while, the connection with the phone is lost and I have to close the application on my phone and restart it to connect again, and at the same time, long press the green button on the device.\nIn an environment with high customer traffic, it takes a long time for the device to say whether the payment has been confirmed. In fact, a minute later, I noticed that a customer's payment was not confirmed, and I asked the customer to follow up and repeat the transaction. Unfortunately, I missed another customer's payment.\n\nUnfortunately, a few of my customers gave up on purchasing due to situations such as checking the charging status of the card reader device, trying to connect the reader to the phone many times in order to receive payment in the market environment.\n\nI was using Sum Up before and the charge of that card reader lasts up to a few weeks, it connects to the phone via bluetooth and goes into sleep mode by itself, and when the process is finished, it becomes active at the same speed.\n\nI am extremely grateful to Account Executive Mr. Paul Emery, who gave me very fast and detailed information and help, but I would like to express with regret that I would like to cancel my membership due to the poor performance of the card reader device, although all member merchant portal and other software parties are very good.\n\nThanks a lot",

Two tried hard to work with me, and each got as far as deciding the problem was beyond their capability to solve, and passed it on to others in your organisation (\"the guys who earn the big bucks\"!).  Sending the error report from my machine produced the response that the problem should now be solved; it wasn't.  The third person, to whom I spoke first in fact, was not helpful, and became insulting at one point, asking if there was someone there who could understand IT, such as a teenager.  This strikes me as not a good way to treat a customer.\nMy final conversation was with Danny, and I told him I was giving up, and he was very understanding about it.  It was nice to speak again with someone who was able to relate in a human way.\nI have since bought a card reader from another company.  It worked perfectly immediately.",

We were promised a phone call back and we didn't get this. with all our card machines down, we were losing customers, they were walking out not being able to pay on card and not having cash on them. The Manager tried to ring several times they gave him the out of hours number on the first phone call and there was no answer, and no phone call back, as you can imagine on a busy weekend this was very frustrating as is costing the business money. The manager then tried ringing several times on Sunday with no answer from the help desk again. The admin then tried calling all of Monday from 10am and eventually got through at 3.30pm, in which they have said all three machines are needing to be replaced as they all share the same Terminal ID number which isn't correct as they need to have their own. Which is not a fault of ours. They also said that the SIM cards in two of the machines have been retired meaning they won't connect to 3G signal again causing issues as we did not request for those SIM's to be retired. Looking over our taking for this weekend compared to last there is big difference. As it is the run up to Christmas this is worrying for me as a business owner as I can't afford for these issues to keep happening. We are waiting for new machine as we desperately need these for this weekend and are waiting for these and new SIM cards.",

Not only did they overcharge me multiple times secretly, but when I had an issue with fraud, they were unresponsive and unhelpful. They even took £650 from me and refused to support me with the card fraud issue, I figured out lately that those terminals can be hacked by some back card were reprogramed by hackers to bypass the admin password and do transaction and they will blame you for security measures and will not even support you and you will have zero rights. Additionally, their transaction fees are outrageous – they charge 1.9% for American Express transactions what is famously known is more expensive than any other credit card but on the other hand they charge 2.5% for normal debit card transactions, how awful this is. \nIt's clear that they're trying to hide extra charges and manipulate transaction fees to make customers pay more.\n\nFurthermore, they fined me each month £70 for not complying with their policy, claiming that they sent me an email to inform me, which they never did. I was never notified that this was a fine, and they charged me without my consent and I discovered that lately after paying all those months. It's frustrating to deal with such a company that plays these games and lacks transparency.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Global Payments. Their service is terrible, and their practices are shady and unethical. It's important to be cautious when dealing with them, as they do not seem to prioritize their customers' needs.\"\n\nI am now seeking legal actions against them. \nI pay now 0.99% with no monthly fees with no hassle with Lopay, and I will be recommending any one to AVOID Global payments.",

I phoned last week to see what the problem was and have been waiting on someone getting back to us. On the 11th of April I received a letter (dated 31st of March) saying that they had been trying to reach us by phone unsuccessfully. I'm not sure what number they've been trying to reach us on but its not our number. The letter states that they have identified that they need extra security to cover the risk associated with continuing to provide card processing services to us as per clause 19 of our contract. There is no reason to explain why we've been considered a risk. All transactions have been processed through their 3Dv2 security checks where liability is with the bank.\n\nSo they have been holding back around £20,000 of our funds since the 31st of March, (which is the same date as the letter they have sent with no letters prior to that). 2 weeks later and I'm still trying to find out what has happened to our £20k. This has caused significant business disruption to my very small family businesses, so will be changing to a new card provider at the earliest opportunity.",

After a lot of conversations with the complaints team a refund was finally agreed on. \n3 weeks, 2 follow up calls and 2 emails later and I still haven’t received my refund. \n\nThis company is not “small business friendly” they make everything difficult and it feels like that is strategic on their part so you just give up and continue to pay the unnecessary fees.

A must if you need to process payments fast.

It was exasperating trying to understand and discuss rates. The charge back system of sending postal notifications only was very unreliable and slow. I am pleased to say the new online system (when working) with email notifications of charge backs is much better - I still have an issue with being charged £20 admin even if the customer is wrong raising a chargeback - surely this should be waivered if merchant has done nothing wrong?\n\nThe real reason for my review is the exceptional service I have just received from Bhav Palmer. Very polite, offered to discount our Visa and Mastercard rates when he saw a big increase in card turnover year on year. He passed on the error code ERR5181123471A for the online portal not working to the relevant department.\nHe also gave me his direct mobile number for future issues, rate changes etc.\n\nI don't write a lot of reviews, but great service deserves it.

Firstly they automatically renew your contract without notice which means you are not allowed to leave for the next 12 months without paying excessive charges.\n\nSecondly the rates for the fees are changed again without notice or warning. So you really have to keep an eye on your statements EVERY single month and a business owner thats a rediculous thing to ask.\n\nLastly the most rediculous thing is even if you cancel the contract within the allocated time frame, they charge you a rediculous fee of £75 + VAT for collecting the terminal!!\n\nPoint is avoid these scammers.",

I have never ever seen this kind of company in my business   life.   customer services very very bad,  management commitment are so awful.  they have non PC charges  unbelievably high compared to any other business   payment solution provider.   they will ripoff  all the  money.   despite of so many communication  and commitment that did not refund my money.  the never send you a bank statement.  you cannot log in  from your mobile. I think government regulatory should   investigate how they charging  customer money.\n my communication reference numbers are-08428458/ 08428303 please Ask Milton and Arif who is your manager. \nVery bad customer service they always shout and cut the line. I am requesting some should resolve this and refund my £602 and £202 asap\nPlease email us or call us 07446422545",

We had a card machine failure after a power cut two weeks ago, called them and spoke to someone, very bad line, she kept asking for the S N number took a while figure out she was referring to the Serial Number eventually got it through that the machine had failed she said that another one would be sent out by courier. A week later, no machine. Ring again and was told that they had record of the call but it had not been passed on to the department that sends out the machine, okay mistakes can be made. Ring another number, yes we will put it on high priority and send one out. Days later no machine, ring again once more told it will be sent on high priority. Two weeks later still no machine or any notification of when it will arrive. Card machines are critical to small businesses and this is unacceptable.",

After we finally signed the contract and we were waiting for them to activate the payment process on our business, we get an email from the employer who was in charge of everything, her name is 'Liana AlHamoui' saying, they are not interested in colaborate with us because it might be risky for them.

Eventually got set up, got the reader…no activation details. More phone calls, more waiting. Finally start using it. The app is a waste of time if you want to use it like a till like I did with my previous provider. And I was promised next day payments and they still took two days. Needless to say I have gone back to my old provider iZettle. Highly recommend them.",

After a public promise to get in contact and rectify the issue, once again Global Payments has withheld a massive amount of money from our account, completely unjustified.\nThis company is dangerous to trust.\nWe are having to make numerous calls to rectify the human errors they have made and the only portal we get is a lowly call centre agent that cannot help nor offer a solution.\n\nGlobal Payments owes us big amount of money which they are refusing to release.\n\nConsider very seriously before you trust this company!\n\nTo Global payments - contact us and release our funds immediately!",

We have already called customer services and logged a complaint - upon doing so the complaints team assigned us to another of Solomons colleagues (ollie burr) who also feels the need to ignore all forms of correspondence.\n\nFirstly; If anyone manages to get lumbered with either of these two, then run a mile - in the meantime I'm hoping that Global Payments decide to rectify this issue before our contract ends.",

The entire onboarding process was easy and we received great support throughout. \n\nWe were assisted throughout the process by Jonathan Whitfield who always attended to any queries promptly, and went above and beyond to find a resolution when we were having issues getting our terminal integrated with our in-store EPOS (issues not caused by Jonathan or Global Payments, to be clear). \n\nI am content as a new client with the company, and am confident that if any issues arise in the future we will be well supported by Jonathan and the team. I have to commend Jonathan in particular as he has been incredibly patient throughout our onboarding, and has taken the time to follow up with us several times once any issues we had were resolved, ensuring that everything was running as expected, and ensuring that any questions he couldn't answer directly were brought to the attention of the wider Global Payments team in order to find a resolution.",

I`m sure that this company won`t do that, looking how they have dealt with the main issue. But you can understand them, its just a small family run business, net income US$605 million (2020)[Wikipedia]. Disgraceful\n\nMr Mobu Miah has contacted me to offer a contract with Global Payment. Since the price is convenient I did switch to this company for my card payments.\nIn the last two months I have so lost more than £2000 because, as we just found out now, the card machine arrived wrongly configured and 2 or 3 transactions a day never went through my bank, even the machine has printed regular authorized receipts.\nThis company is now trying to blame us for modifying the configuration of the machine, to avoid any kind of liability in this situation. This company has miserably failed to provide their service and caused me an irreparable damage , since I cant ask my customers to pay now what they have bought a month or two ago.\nOn the top of that, my email to Mr Mobu are not been answered, only after I spent hours trying other colleagues to reach to him. His phone line sounds free, when I'm been told he's busy on another call.\nExtremely disappointed, I will have to try now legal action against this company, to recover the loss it has caused to me.",

Andy came in and understood the business we ran and how this could be improved with Global's system - as well as saving us money!\n\nPreviously we would take telephone orders and later process them and ring through our 1 physical card terminal. This new system enables the staff to be able to process the order at the time of taking, because they are then all able to use the virtual terminal online to process their card payments.\n\nWe now use Global as our website payment gateway too, which has been great to be able to have all our payments now under one roof (previously Opayo).\n\nWe are very rural and occasionally have serious problems losing internet or power, and the new terminals have the function to use the built in sim card so we are still able to take payments.\n\nSo far our experience has been brilliant and we are very happy :)",

They wanted to talk me through cancelling it whilst on the phone and I was correct we did not have it. They would not believe me , but after calling and calling them to investigate they eventually refunded me stating it  was  a goodwill gesture!! Though they did not refund me the correct amount. \nThe final straw came when they upgraded our terminal and we could not get it working,  they sent two in total and neither would work. I was so frustrated with their poor service I decided to cancel our contract. I gave them 30 days notice.\nThey then decided to add £150 plus vat to the final invoice  for the 2 terminal restocking in fees even though they advised that they were scrapping them! \nI have spent hours and hours chasing this company for errors that were not our fault and even a promise of compensation that never materialised. \nOhh and I am still awaiting a copy of my contract as they stated the re stocking in fee of the terminals was on the contract.

I asked waitress whether everything went right, and she showed me my order, which excluded that one item. (which I have paid for, but didnt receive). I decided to reorder that one item again, but GPN said something like \"you dont have enough money on your credit card\". Which was obviously not true, so I checked my bank account and I found out that I was charged 2x16€. After all I was refunded the 1x16€ but still, I lost 5€ on that excluded item which I had to reorder. Definitely wouldnt recommend to anyone. Terrible experience, wont be using their service again.",

Once we moved to email Puja Patel, who took my call, and dealt with my query sent me the required paperwork and responded quickly once I had submitted it.  \n\nI, like many others I'm sure, have so little confidence that contacting large corporations on the phone and online will result in a positive result. It's always feels so impersonal. Even if you get a real live human being, you feel like you are being processed as they go through their script.  But my experience with Puja wasn't like that: she responded to the things I said; asked pertinent questions and made me feel confident that I was understood.\n\nAnd best of all, I wasn’t transferred so I had to explain to someone else why I was calling. Puja dealt with it all. So great that Global Payments empowers their people to deal with clients from the start of their enquiry to the resolution.",

It makes you question your own complaint when you see a company such as this is clearly taking care of most of their customers and I am left wondering why does it seem that I am not sharing the same positive experience, especially when the experience I have had is so overwhelmingly negative that I was left no choice to not just write an email of complaint, not just  contact a financial ombudsman but actually have to contact the police. I wont go into too many details it being that the situation will be investigated, but the very last thing you want is a company dealing with your money that are so untrustworthy that there are accusations of fraud. And we aren't talking a bit of poor service or accidentally shared information here. To make matters worse Global Payments will not even address the issue, just sighting policy because they do not want to take the face an offence has been committed either by them or on their watch. There are so many card merchant services out there. You have absolutely no reason to risk using this one.\n\nUpdate - Also despite providing information to contact me Global Payments haven't bothered. The dispute is all but settled with their partner company who are currently addressing my concerns. Global Payments.....just sending threatening letters despite being informed that the contract is to be closed.",

        "text": "Dreadful service. Our website has been unable to take payments properly for over a week now. Global Payments plugin team, after a slow response, have done a lot of troubleshooting to work out why the plugin can no longer communicate with Global Payments properly. They have even installed our site on their own server and still get the same issue. Global Payments support ignore your emails - we contacted their support about this 7 days ago, have followed up several times, and have not had any response. Global payments also do not appear to have a complaints procedure, hence this review, or even an address to send a complaint to, other than the support email. On speaking to a support staff on the phone, the first said we needed a developer to fix the issue and that they could not help. On another support call, I asked if she was outside as there appeared to be what sounded like wind blowing in her phone, she asked me to hang on, then put me on hold for 25 minutes, and then said she'd emailed a link. We are moving to a new merchant account provider, with UK-based support. Really dreadful service",

I was completely new to card machine and was not told anything about end of day process. \nNo issues till July 2020 where i see that i have stopped receiving payments from 2nd July to 9th July (over £1500) worth of payments in my account. I call them and they kept diverting me to Paymentsense (their card terminal provider)\nAnd Apparently paymentsense did the same thing of asking me to call global payments. They did that for 2 days and kept me lingering. \n\nAfter that i was told that they manually did the end of day process for me for so long because i did not do it and they stopped doing that after the 2nd july 2020. (Guys, why did you not call me and let me know all this? When you can call and irritate folk to join you and you stick a 48month contract with me)\nSo they asked for receipts that i unfortunately did not have and hencewhy they did not do a thing. I raised it with their supervisor and was rudely got back. I could sense it that they are not going to return my money and the did not. I lost £1500 just after i had reopened my shop after lockdown. \nSimple question. \nIf you did my end of day manually from 22oct to 1st july, what happened suddenly that you stopped doing it and also did not call me once and tell me or teach me the process??",

We then got email confirmation of this as well. Then a different Global Payments representative told us that actually our account wasn’t closed! And even if it was their error, we still had to pay the money! I spent hours and hours of my life trying to sort the situation out and eventually, again, got a confirmation over the phone from Global Payments that the situation was sorted, the account was closed and we didn’t owe anything (and that they were sorry). \nNow this morning, I have received an email….. you guessed it, a bill from Global Payments (this time asking for 34p).

I asked my person Manager Ollie to explain to me, he said I have to talk to customer service team, and give me a number start with 0345, which cost me 35p per mins, I spend 13 pounds to call CS team, they said they will send the invoice to me via email, but they never did that.

Called in February as noticed I was being charged for no transactions, and not being PCI compliant (when I contacted them months ago to sort it out) Was advised that I would not be charged that amount, however, I changed to DOJO as the service from Inspire and Global is shocking.  Received a demand letter today for £95 from March?  Called up and they literally don't understand simple logic.\n\nBe wary of any card terminal company that outsources payments to others, and also ties you in for more than a month.  There is absolutely no need anymore for this, as other companies are a monthly rolling business, and I have to say are far more helpful because of it.  All queries sorted out in seconds, PCI done on the terminal, and customer service staff who want to sort out your issue there and then. \n\nI don't see any benefit in companies like Inspire or Global anymore as their model is outdated, and doesn't benefit customers.\n\nPS - if you are going to put your name to a demand letter, ensure the grammar is correct, and you have actually sent someone a CORRECT invoice.  It makes you look incompetent, especially when your CS advisor says that a customer has to REQUEST it, meaning we have never received it!",

Just before we were due to reopen on 17 May, I discovered that Global payments had closed my account because I owed them £15.08.  They refused to reactivate it because it was out the 6 month \"grace\" period by 2 weeks.  The only solution was to set up a new merchant ID account.  I got my MID at 4:57pm on Weds (2nd June) and was told all I needed to do was give RMS a ring to activate the new MID with my card machine.  Simple process??  No, not at all.  RMS couldn't see my new MID and had to call Global Payments, who informed them the account had been set up incorrectly and they would need to change it to be an RMS account.  Global Payments have no sense of urgency and if customer service agents keep saying \"Basically....\" to me I will end up blowing my top!  I am unable to reopen without a card reader and therefore losing money - are Global Payments going to reimburse me???  I doubt it!",

        "text": "We have started using Retail merchant services for a card terminal back in April 2020. RMS use global payments, Why i have no idea. I was aware of becoming PCI compliance and there would be a fee of £75 a month if not compliant. After endless amount of attempts with this. RMS has admitted there was a issue with logins. I have had 5 or 6 password resets to be able to get in to become PCI compliance. Till this day Global payments have racked up a £2000 bill for us and have taken out of our account without notifying us. I have finally been able to sort out PCI with a email on the 2nd Feb from RMS to congratulate me on becoming PCI compliant. I have received this email 'I am emailing you today regarding your PCI Compliance I have been advised by Global Payments that an extension was placed on your account to complete the PCI and I have been advised that this should avoid any fees being applied In March.' And what do you know today another £150 has been withdrawn from our account? I don't get how this is even legit to just take what ever money they want from our account and get away with it? The issue i have is that on numerous phone calls they seem to blame each other? They both try to pass the blame on and try and redirect my call. Very unhappy!!! If anyone knows how i can take this further would be much appropriated.",

        "text": "This review refers to my experiences with the Ecom Support team, which I would have rated 4/5 from 2008 to 2019, but has been very different in 2020 and 2021. Hopefully not all departments have been affected by the same decline.\n\nWe have been using - and recommending - their payment gateway integration since the HSBC-branded and Realex days. Support and developer documentation were both excellent up until 2020, but in the last 12 months the availability, quality and timeliness of responses has fallen off a cliff, to a level that - even cutting some slack for the pandemic - is currently inexcusable, so poor that it resembles a customer support parody more than it does a global organisation entrusted with our transactions.\n\nThey have been simply unrecognisable from the organisation where account managers and ecommerce support would always reply to emails by the end of the next working day and often the same day.\n\nThey have gone from that to a shambles, Ecom Support no longer seem to answer the phone (I have been on hold for over an hour at times with no answer), they ignore/lose many emails, and on the rare occasions that emails are replied to they are replied to a week or more late, often with obvious delaying tactics that ask a pointless question which they already have the answer to within the thread they are replying to (or would have the answer to hand if they were actually using a proper ticketing system), so that one has to reply and wait another week for another response.\n\n[update] It took several months of emails back and forth with long delays between replies, to achieve what should have been possible in a 5-10 minute phone call - and it had still not been completed by the time of first writing this review. After leaving a critical review I was contacted by a member of the Customer Experience team the same day, who was polite, understanding and apologetic, and asked me to forward the details of my case to them to escalate on my behalf. The final part of my long standing request was resolved the next working day.\n\nI have since been asked to revise my review. Several months of delays, hours of chasing, time spent on hold with no answer, checking social media and developer communities to see whether my issue was unique (it wasn't), time wasted planning workarounds, have cost unnecessary time and therefore money. So whilst I am relieved to have my particular issue resolved for now, I won't be improving my 1 star rating until it is earned by future positive experiences.\n\nI just hope that this situation is temporary and a cruel coincidence of increased workload from SCA / 3DSv2 / PSD2 coinciding with reduced staffing levels due to the pandemic, and that we will see a return to acceptable customer service before long.\n\nI know what it's like to be a developer with too many tickets and not enough time, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The pandemic should however not be an excuse for not implementing the basics that an organisation of this size should have - for example a proper support ticketing system instead of a shared mailbox with an apologetic autoresponse; for example a phone number that actually gets answered (even if it's only by a less-technical gatekeeper advising you what the delay is and where you can expect to be in the queue) and a phone number that does not keep you on hold indefinitely at times when there is no chance of it being answered.\n\nIn the meantime my advice to others unfortunately is that if you are waiting weeks or months for a response then your best option is to complain the loudest in public in order to jump the queue.",

        "text": "Really poor performance from Global Payments. As a customer we have been trying to get 3DS2 enabled and implemented for the December 2020 deadline since the summer of this year. \n\nAfter receiving initial instructions from Global Payments we have had our MIDs enabled for 3DS2 and now have to get Global Payments to switch it on for us. However, this seems to be impossible. There are no responses from the ecomm support team via e-mail (numerous attempts to make contact) and when you try to call you are either on hold for over an hour and cut off or the call won't even connect. It seems that all marketing queries are being answered, however, existing customers are being ignored. \n\nThere is now a very high risk that we will not have 3DS2 enabled by the end of December deadline and there is a potential that customer payments will be declined as threatened on the Global Payments website. The website also states that Global Payments ensures a  'No-Hassle Compliance for Our Customers' - this is the furthest from our experience so far. \n\nHaving read other reviews, the lack of customer support seems to be a common problem and is completely unacceptable. \n\nWe will be happy to re-evaluate our rating if acceptable service is provided going forward.\n\nUpdate - was asked to provide information, followed the link and submitted information but apparently this hasn't been received. Double checked and it won't let me re-submit information. Have emailed the contact provided.",

Ask to speak with a line-manager and we are put on old for another 30mins and then disconnected.\n\nWe've clients who you still won't activate 3D Secure V2 - this is becoming a legal requirement to accept payments in a few days but there is no response or details from your team. Constantly promised that it will be done \"tomorrow\" and nothing is done. \n\nWe'll be advising our clients to avoid you in the future.\n\nThe previous review is still included below...\nI work at a web agency. Over the year, Global Payments have had their issues with a lack of communication due to COVID-19. \n\nI have to say Michael in their Ecommerce Support team in Ireland has gone out of his way to help and provide support during these hard time. He consistently resolves issues in a fraction of the time it would take with anyone else. He is helpful and is a perfect example of top level support. \n\nWe can't thank him enough. The highest complement is - if we could, we'd happily take him onto our own team in a heartbeat!",

        "text": "since Realex Payments moved to global payments we have had shocking customer support. The helpdesk is no longer in Dublin and now resides in the Philippines. Today I wasted 10 minutes trying to reach an agent then when I reached an agent I had to wait for further 10 minutes for them to contact Dublin helpdesk I was unable to get any resolution as I was left waiting on the phone for a further 10 minutes. This is such a shame to see a successful Irish company Now tarnished with this very poor public image. \n\nA long-term client now considering moving all their ecom businesses to Stripe.\n\n- Update to Nicole reply\n@Nicole appreciate the reply but I have not received a call since to see how this service could be improved?\n\nI have received a reply to my email request since however is this what we are to expect email-only service from a company that used to answer the phone with technical ppl that could resolve issues within 2 minutes of calling?\n\nReply to Nicole\n- I have given further details to contact me. Also please note your help desk person who left me on hold whilst trying to reach the Dublin tech support team (for 10+ minutes) never returned my call.\n\n16/12/2020 Reply 3 to Nicole, \n- We received an email from Michael at ecomsupport_AT_globalpay.com\nDo you have access to your support comms?\n\nStill awaiting a call to review the experience, Nicole.\n\n17/12/2020 reply 4 to Nicole\nStill waiting on call Nicole...\n\n23/12/2020 reply 5 to Nicole\nAfter lots of digging through VERY poor documentation for 3dsecure v2 API, we managed to get this last-minute update in. \n\nCan you please compare Stripe SCA docs to your own? you will see a very large gap of knowledge and bugs in the code given. \n\nvery disappointing.\n\n09/Feb/2021 - update\n2 months on and we are still waiting on getting 3DS v2 issues resolved. Clients are losing money...\nThis is crazy ... API code is unstable and we get different errors every day.\n\n08/Sep/2021 - update\nWe have since moved away from GP except for 2 remaining accounts. We had an issue with one of them and are on hold now for 10mins... Spoken to 3 difference 'Johns'... they cannot see logs of errors from Manilla helpdesk which is tier 1. \n\nThey did a bad job taking over such a proud IRISH company (Realex Payments).\n\nWill have our remaining 2/37 accounts moved by end of the year over to Stripe. 2% charge with no issues versus small transaction charge plus LOTS of issues. It's a no-brainer. Stay away from these guys.\n\n30minutes later I am still on hold .... this is ridiculous\n...\n40 minutes on hold ...\n.....\n50 minutes on hold ... on hold waiting to speak to tech support in Dublin\n\n54 minutes ... later I got speaking to a trainee tech support who asked some further queries around the problem that was detailed in our email (that was sent 24hrs previous)\n\n65 minutes ... put on hold again so he could ask a senior tech person ... Seriously if anyone in GP is reading this you need to sit up and read this and review your support process.\n\n12/Oct/2021\n\nThe saga continues...\n\nSince posting this updated I got 4 mobile calls to my personal mobile phone from an unknown caller id all in one day, a voicemail from an Italian person asking to speak regarding this post with no direct number given to call him back...\n\nWe received no phone to our support desk as requested.\nSince then we have had ongoing issues with the remaining 2 accounts we have left with GP.\n\n09.50 I am once again listing to holding music for now 10 minutes waiting to speak to anyone on their Dublin (manilla) phone number.\n\n10.06 Put through to Manilla helpdesk to speak with someone regarding Real control access in test mode \n\n10.25 has taken me 30 minutes to explain the situation over the phone. I have been asked to email the issue 4 times and have refused as I am waiting 5 days for any reply from their email support channel.\n\n10.27 currently explaining to the technician how to spell one of our client's name in English ...\n\n10.30 on hold .....\n\n10.39 spelling my company name using phonetic alphabet...\n\n10.45 We now find out there is no way to login separately to TEST versus LIVE environments! We need to reactivate our own GP account so we don't interrupt our client every time we want to run a test!\n\n11.09 still on phone trying to get test access. I am being told I can create new user access to my client's account however it will still have access to LIVE env information. From a security and GDPR standpoint, this is a huge concern for us...\n\n11.18.. helpline disconnected ....\n\nSorry guys last two accounts are going asap...\n\n18/Nov/2021\nTrying to get access to our account it seems our login has been turned off ...\n\nEmailed ecomsupport globalpay.com several times but no reply?",

As a company we feel Global Payments should contact their clients to inform/notify of the increases to make us aware and find out how you can offer alternative rates to keep us as clients.\n\n• Charged £150 extra over 6 weeks for PCI compliance fine - we pay £3.50 each month for this service and we are more than aware it takes a click of a button to administer this (after speaking to other companies we have since found out that this is a service they provide for their clients to avoid fines) NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS CHARGE AT ALL!\n\n• Charging £15 per month for the online statements - this is free with other merchants and who also have free apps to download to keep track of charges and fees\n\n• Card terminal charge - £25 per month, other providers charge around £15 \n\n• Paper statements- we have asked on numerous occasions to stop paper statements, the day we signed up with Global Payments we stated we preferred to have no paper statements but yet we still are receiving these at a charge £4 per month.\n\n• Customer services - has been less than adequate until we said we are leaving.... we have called on many occasions and not had call backs... we called last Thursday morning and the representative on the phone said she would have someone call back as urgent and nothing and its now Tuesday and still no call. \n\nTO TOP IT OFF... a fee of £75 for refurbishment of the terminal WHAT??? We have paid Global Payments above and beyond for the terminal and for other excess fees this just confirms we are doing the best thing by leaving this company.",

Up until recently, I could not fault them; the support was there and on time.\n\nUnfortunately, this has changed, and the support has become non-existent. I emailed them on Oct 2nd, then sent multiple reminders, 30 days later, and I am yet to hear back.\nThe customer support phone line is practically gone; there is no way to talk to anyone when you ring. Instead, there is a pre-recorded message, that they have been receiving an exceptionally large number of calls, and that the preferred method of contacting support is via email - which they don't respond to anyway! In that pre-recorded message they provide a local mobile phone number to ring in critical cases. I tried that, there is no answer, and voicemails left are not being returned.\n\nI am posting this as a last resort, hoping that someone in Global Payments does read these reviews. You can't just treat your loyal, longstanding customers like this, and throw your good, hard-earned reputation out the window?\n\nI do hope to hear back.",

It should have been a huge warning sign when we were finding \"mistakes\" with fees in the contract versus what had been quoted to us. Fees not listed in the contract are constantly being added. These are not just nickel and dime fees. The added reoccurring monthly fees are hundreds per month. Then there are the quarterly added fees and the annual added fees. We were also incorrectly charged PCI noncompliance fees for over a year when we were in compliance. We have made numerous calls to try to find out what fees were, corrections that needed to be made, and follow-ups from credits due.\n\nWhen we initially signed with Global payments (also known as Open Edge), we were told and shown that we would save on average about $200 a month in fees. When doing a cost comparison, we found that in 2019 our overall credit card revenue went down from 2018 by 2.6%, but our fees went up 12.6%!!!",

I raised a concern regarding an incorrect address being added to our account - someone within the new business team had used Google to find our address, instead of follwoing protacol and using the application forms we had completed.  Our terminal went to an old business address, one we have not used for over 10 years.  All our address details on the terminal were incorrect too and needed to be changed, resulting in a delay and to be quite honest, caused me to have some concerns about how this business is run - data  protection comes to mind!! Nevertheless, I had a call from someone within the complaints department who ASSURED me it would be sorted, and our address corrected.  This was on the 7th July - (my negative review seems to have disappeared).  I got a call yesterday from the PCI compliance to check that we were following compliance - THEY HAD THE WRONG ADDRESS - I was not impressed.  To add insult to injury, I have just registered for the Global Payments Portal - and the ADDRESS IS STILL WRONG!!! What on earth is going on with this company?  I have tried to speak to someone but the phone just rings and rings - I am so frustrated I could explode!!",

We would not have been able to do it without you and we would have been in a difficult situation in September without it. So our students/customers owe you a debt of gratitude as do we.\n \nYou have been very helpful and quick to grasp our business needs whilst being instantly available if there are any issues. Your willingness to communicate directly with our suppliers has saved us many hours in planning during the implementation phase of this project and I hope leads to some key relationships and opportunities for the future. \n \nWe cannot thank you enough for your time\n \nBest Wishes\n\nAlex\nUniversity of Northampton",

The due diligence process was very thorough, but entirely understandable for a regulated payments service, however, I was delighted to have been approved. At every step my area manager, Andy Flint, was attentive and supportive of my application, which is refreshing in this era of algorithm-based decisioning, where the personal touch can be completely absent. I couldn't recommend or praise the entire Global Payments team more highly and look forward to a very long and successful partnership.",

        "text": "NIGHTMARE Howard \"Buddy\" Cooper is the WORST salesperson I've ever experienced in my 20+ years of business. Buddy hides from my phone calls for 6 WEEKS after I submitted our bank statements, so I finally asked customer service to let me work with a diff sales agent. Then Buddy magically reappears and we finally get on the phone and we AGREE to schedule Friday weekly calls. He then misses the FIRST CALL and every single call we scheduled after that - no progress. Then a month later, I find out our account was actually approved weeks before, no communication from Buddy - and finally when we speak, and Buddy still has NO IDEA we got approved. Buddy then arranged a physical storefront audit to a registered agent address which has no store front, REALLY?...the application (and account type) was clearly for an e-commerce website. So 2 months go by and Buddy then asks for our last 3 months bank statements, which we had ALREADY submitted! So I ask a customer service manager again to let me work with diff salesperson - they say yes but nobody reaches out. A week later I call again and get the name of the NEW person we're supposed to deal with - I email that person. No reply. I call again and they tell me the new rep will surely reach out within 3 biz days. No contact. I email new person again. No reply. Repeat 3 more times via customer service. Every time we speak, the story is the same \"wait 3 business days and someone will reach out\". I specifically ask them to reach out via email so that there is a record. Nobody reaches out. NOT EVEN AN EMAIL. Global Payments took almost 3 months to approve our account...then, even AFTER we are approved, they cannot figure out how to schedule a setup call for us to be able to start accepting payments. It actually feels like they are messing with us on purpose. I have given up after 3 months of back and forth and Buddy's overwhelming negligence. On top of everything, Buddy tried to throw in a monthly fee of $100 PER MONTH for a Non-PCI Compliance fee. I have never seen a Non-PCI fee that high in my entire career and I have been in the Merchant Services industry for over a decade. Thanks, Buddy, you're killing it. Literally. DO NOT work with this business. If they weren't such a huge company I'd say it feels more like a scam business with how MIA they are and how NOBODY knows what's going on. Extreme negligence. Bad vibes all around. No accountability. Never went anywhere. Work with these guys and your business will get stuck in the mud too. Yeesh! NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE",

(This was all before the quarentine lockdown so no excuse really).\nthis is my email to them which they have completely blanked. \n\nFirst of all, id like to make a complaint, and dispute the cost I've been given, as for 90% of the month my card reader has been unusable.\n\nFirst of all:\nWhen I joined, I had been told I will have money in the bank the next day. I haven’t had a single case of this yet. Im still awaiting a transaction 4  business days later…\n\nSo from the start.\nI had to constantly chase global payments to see how my application was going, constantly getting promised updates and calls back which I never received. \nOnce the machine had been received, no one followed up, until I called saying I cant do any transactions, only training ones. I also complained about my personal address being on the receipt. \nAfter countless calls and no one getting back to me, a nice gentleman notified me the card machine was faulty. Great.\nSo I got instructed to return the machine just as I received it and it will be a simple swap over. \nOnce new machine arrived, it had 0 rolls with it, no charging leads. Just the bare machine.\nI went to one transaction of the £5800 and had that banked. Well I thought I did.\n\nNoone told me about the end of day. They told me theyd show me how to do it, but again. Countless calls and emails. No replies. But I could look in the manual right? No. again the machine had nothing in the box\nAfter googling it I finally found out how to do it. So I tried to do it…but wait, theres a code on it. \nSo again countless calls and getting told id have a call back. NOTHING. Until I finally got through to someone who could help, who finally lifted the code and got that resolved. End of day done and money in a few days later. \nAfter the countless end of days and trying to resolve this, the tiny bit of receipt paper I had, was gone.\n\nSo the next customer - £280 (still awaiting to get that banked, I took the transaction days over 2 weeks ago now)\nThis machine was useless to me with no receipt paper. But was informed of a cardholder not present way I could do.  This was not the way I was shown later on,they told me to call a number and simply follow it. So I did (0345 number)\nAfter being given a transaction authorisation  code I then left, thinking it was successful. \nUnable to do the end of day, I had to wait for the paper. So more calls and emails and phone calls I finally got the message across. And the cables came… just no paper. AGAIN I called, and a few days later the paper came through.\nSo I popped that in, did the end of day … £0..?\nSo more and more phonecalls later and emails. And I had a call through. To be told. The method id been given was wrong. \nSo I had to carry out the transaction again. The only thing is the customer is 50 milesfrom me. So an embarrassing phonecall to him, and him getting a bit edgy about it, I finally got the details. \nSo again after a phonecall back, I attempted the transaction…unable. Again,….unable.\nTurns out the machine didn’t have it installed. ( by the way im doing all of this while still working, a massive huge inconvenience for me, and extremely distressing)\nSo after finishing a job, the gentleman installed the update and I attempted the transaction with him on the line. \nIt went through.\nIts showing online on my portal as gone through. Yet it hasn’t touched my account. \nI've emailed numerous times, yet no replies. An absolute joke.\nSo here I am, being told to cough up £450. For a machine which has been redundant for me. \nThe customer service I have received has been absolutely abysmal. Horrific infact.\nHow HSBC have you as a partner goes beyond me.",

When I complained was told I should have cancelled it and I was now signed up for 1 year. I am a very low user only about 5 or 6 transactions a month so have now cancelled was told that there would be no cancellation or terminal uplift fees guess what they have just taken over £100 pound out of my account which I am trying to find out what for. Have now been sitting on the phone for over an hour to talk to customer services so that tells me that the customer services is not very good. All I can say if you are looking for a card terminal I would highly recommend you look elsewhere, anywhere but certainly not global payments. Because I am a low user I have decided to go with izettle after the initial payment of £29 for the card reader the charges are only 1.5% per transaction with no extra costs or cancellation fees.So I'll give them a bash and see how I get on.",

Terminal replaced due to upgrade & old age quickly. Good CS responsive on phone but never really needed much.\nHowever checking the rates these last few days I find it is a LOT cheaper elsewhere. Foolishly my fault/faith in companies keeping prices reasonable for loyalty.\nComparing the main, normal credit card fee (majority of my business) other payments are much better also.\nI find I can get 0.9% cheaper from Barclaycard (I only name as not some obscure provider). I can do quite a bit better still if I go non-mainstream, which I am considering.\nI am fairly sure I will go from about £400pm to £250 if I go BC and elsewhere easily under £200, saving over £200 per month!!\n\nI know there were regular letters \"had to increase prices\" \"in line with industry\" \"sorry but the extra costs involved\", I believed them, then they really went to town with the extra's charges, perhaps across the industry though, I guess the special loyalty cards, it seems we were covering all the costs for them to give card holders those benefits. Originally told these would have minimal effect, barely notice on our bills, a few %. Mine ended up being about 10% extra on my invoices.\nI know when I moved to them many years ago I did so because they had the very good rates, I did thorough research then. I quickly looked back & it does seem had a relentless 0.1% or so increase each year.\n\nI am angry at my failure to check, every other utility/insurance I am fanatical about getting the best rates, fortunately it does seem the gap has widened slowly else I would be thinking around £20K over the 10 years but still sure many thousands worse off.\n\nI would love to know what rates similar companies/turnover get or if I applied now. I can't imagine anyone would go with them, perhaps new businesses/poor turnover/average trans/risk they are comparable.\nThey should analyse business & even reduce rates but certainly hold steady unless absolutely necessary. in 10 years I bet they have never had a single refund or disputed transaction, average of £120 and 99% face to face, turnover steady increase & cards a higher percentage over cash,cheques, every year.\nTempted to try their retention's just to see what they offer but so angry I simply checked on termination fees. Made me laugh £75 restocking fee for card terminal. I thought the 10 years of monthly rental might have covered that. Gave them £5K last year and all those years & they want £75, says a lot.",

The new online system is by far the worst, least user friendly system and they know this, because i was told this when i rang them.\nContacting them on their help line to sort the problem out, was again a very frustrating process, let alone having to understand someone who doesnt speak good english and is rude. \nIt was utter ignorance from the person talking to me a few thousand miles away, not understanding how important it was to submit my statements via email to my accountant.\nI hasten to add, nothing wrong with my computer, all cookies cleared, just their system!\nNot being able to submit my online bank statements on time was a tedious task and lenthy. Going paperless is not a good idea in this instance, you get charged for this privilege for postage admin costs and you pay again to send recorded delivery a week later to your accountant!\nThankfully timing of this awful experience, coincided with a Payment Consultant called Stuart L, recommendation from another business to get in touch with in.\nHe was astounded when showing him my last 12 months bank statements , and said we had been utterly ripped off , paying over 60 percent more a month on average than most businesses with our turnover.\nEven though being PCI compliant for a number of years , I was paying £1200 interests charges on card payments a month on £40,000 , yet Stuart has clients with a turnover of £375,000 per month with interest charges of less than a £1000 per month.\nOn Stuart’s recommendation , i switched to Paymentsense and my interests charges are 70 percent less than Global Payments. They would be a lot lower than this , if I didn’t have customer not present transactions. When you run a hotel , you take payment within your cancellation policy, so a customer who doesn’t show , unfortunately for them they are charged. But we pay a commission for this ontop of the card charges for visa debit, mastercards of an extra 0.9 percent via global payments compared to 0.2 percent and less with other merchant providers. \nSwitching to Paymentsense was the best thing I ever did, they are transparent, rates are very low and customer service is excellent.\nIt took 2 weeks to set up, not the utter rubbish Global payments say which they takes 3 months and would ultimately got another £3600 out of me on their card transaction charges. \nSeriously everyone out there using Global payments are being ripped off, they are not transparent, charging customers extorntionate interest card rates, poor customer service, poor online banking system and simply a scam.",

        "text": "[AVOID AVOID AVOID] Business located in Calgary - This company overcharged us about $9,500 in fees over 1 year and 3 months. Initially, you start out paying the average collective ~5% for processing credit cards (including monthly fees, and their thousand other fees). Then they increased it (by adding more fees) June 2018 to 8-9% of our sales. Apparently, they gave us \"notice\" through back page on our month statement that does not get mailed out (you can only access through website, and my parents are not tech savvy nor is their primary language English). AND THEN, they added MORE FEES AGAIN in March 2019 to collectively equal 10-12% of our total credit card sales. THIS IS ROBBERY. If you don't refute within 3 months, it means you've accepted the rate. My parents only started taking notice when their bank account balance seriously began to dwindle then I came in to investigate. They have offered to lower the collective rates to about 40% of current 10-12% charge, but that's still higher than other major merchant rates. We are going to change.\n\nWATCH OUT everyone. They're scam artists, they tell you to go get a lawyer if you want to try to get your money back. Terrible. They will keep increasing your fees if you don't take notice and they will singlehandedly BANKRUPT you by bleeding you dry. Also, there is a $700 cancellation charge because your contract \"auto\" renews, so even if you've been with the company for 6-7 years, and they havemade a fortune off you, they will still do this. Check their 2018 earnings result - RECORD HIGH - at the cost of their customers.",

Everyone we've spoken with, whether in their London or Dublin offices has, without exception, been very knowledgeable and remarkably friendly.\n\nIn short, we simply cannot recommend Global Payments highly enough.

        "text": "Cut off 4 times one morning last week, three times to staff in Manilla and once to someone in Leicester who put me through to a dead tone. I asked for the Manilla operator to take my number in case it happened again - but was told that a call back wasn't guaranteed - of course yet again on the path to being hung up on because I had asked for something. They hung up. This is what you can expect from the caring customer focused staff in the Philippines. Cannot log in to Business View and their verification code doesn't work either. They have switched to a new system - which I cannot log in to either. Spent about 2 hours trying to resolve it. Going  back a couple of years Security Metrics' scans (Global Payments' partner) made it ridiculously difficult to pass compliance standards compared to Trustwave, a PCI market leader. Never had any issue with Trustwave and Global Payments makes no money out of the relationship - funny that. Under Security Metrics scan failures allow Global Payments to charge high monthly penalties - what a winner! Their charges are the highest we have come across for PCI penalties. Their card fees are high too - although if you negotiate you can bring down the rate to a more competitive percentage; this has to be renegotiated annually. Recently £15 per month has begun to be added to my bill for Reporting Pro (not optional - just informed of this change). Consequently we can't wait to switch provider after 8 years - honestly don't know how this company can pick up good reviews?\nUpdate: Left Global Payments a year ago now, thank goodness. Stripe has been great.",

The number of questions and procedure we have gone through to get the application of mobile terminal has been ridiculous, with alot of questions and long process. We are a trustworthy community, with account at HSBC contain over £100,000 and growing every month. I had to provide alot of information about the community and myself even though I already own personal account at HSBC too. I am very disappointed with the service. It has taken around a month yet I haven't received this mobile terminal. More question has been provided such as I need to provide a letter of which I have requested from Cupquest regarding the disputed issues I had with Bank of Scotland which the matter has been sorted and Payment has been completed for sometime now. I spoke to cupquest the said I will receive the letter within 10 days. \n\nPlease clarify what is CCj letter is.. I want to make sure we are speaking or talking about same thing. Or I am chasing the same-thing I don’t want to waste time. The mobile termnal so far seems is impossible to get from you, I feel we should go to other company at to provide us Mobile Terminal service. Why I should be in question as the community is clean and has account with HSBC for many years with over 100,000 in the account. We would consider moving bank as HSBC as it’s seems to be difficult on this very straight forward matter.  The trust of HSBC on us seems very confuse. \n\nMany Thanks \nArrahman",

The customer service is laughable, I am so unimpressed with them (and the repeat parroting as I was passed up the food chain) I no longer wish to use them. However customer services can't close my account, that has to be my account manager. They can't put me through to my account manager, neither can they give me a contact number for my manager. How do I close my account? I apparently have to wait for said manager to call me. They were quick enough to call when they wanted my business. I've wasted 90 minutes on the phone to them already, and still no resolution. \nSo I've already signed up within minutes to a company who is of the new generation of card readers, and so simple.",

Firstly, when it come to the intitial contract agreement, my company was promised competitive rate charges on the Credit and Debit card transaction fees. Only recently, I analysed the statements and failed to see that I have been exploited over the course of the contract, Global Payments had added multiple additional charges and ‘service’ fees that were not initially discussed in the contract agreement with my business. \nI then decided to compare prices elsewhere and found that many of Global payments fees were 20% higher than its competitors.  In addition to the massive savings in debit/credit charges Offered by other companies,  I found that many of the ‘service’ fees provided by Global payments were just another way they used to exploit myself and my business.\nI found the customer service team very difficult to deal with when I had any problems with my card machine , it would take weeks to sort anything out. I found myself being bounced around different departments of the telephone support team and any time I was promised a call back… nothing. I tried to contact Global payments regarding my rates while still in contract and received a response almost 3 weeks later. However, when it came to an issue Global Payments had with myself, the response would be almost instant. \nUpon ending my contract with global payments, I was charged for a full month’s rental because one of the payments had went through on the 1st day of the following month. Furthermore, I was charged a ridiculous terminal collection fee of £30+Vat. \n\nDo your research !",

I've recently been speaking to one of their team about a problem that was totally not of their making and there were many times when they could have told me it was my website providers job to sort it out (it really was) but he didn't - he kept plugging away at it with me. I've also spoken to them before about fees charged and some kind soul there spent half an hour explaining all aspects of my invoices and where savings could be made - it was well beyond the call of duty. So, in summary, I like them. Lucy",

The only reason my bussniss survived is that personally I can support it until I’ll get the money back.\nSo please if you want your bussniss to keep on going stay far away from this company!\nI hope that this company will be shut down and go broke there is no place in 2019 for a company that behave this way and I’m sure you will pay for all the losses you caused me.",

As if the charges (including PCI compliance) are not enough of a rip off, they have now moved from previous day payments credited to my account to 3, sometimes 5 days and I cannot actually speak to a human being, to resolve this. Now looking to move acquirer. and also make a formal complaint to HSBC, FCA and Consumer Credit If I could have given less than one star, I would have. They shouldn't be in business.\n\nUpdate 26 April 2019; reply received to my review, suggesting an on-line contact would resolve my issues. Just to record that I had already independently done this and have had one reply, which completely missed the point. Will wait to see on that one. Most commercial bank managers I have spoken to, think modern technology and Gb connections should speed up, rather than delay receipts. Talking to other retaillers, Global Payments name seems to come up often and not in a good light. The fact remains, funds have gone out of customer bank accounts and are taking anywhere from 3 to 5 days longer to reach mine. Somebody is making a turn, somewhere. Just be honest about it!",

So i wait for my transactions to appear in bank. Have they arrived NOPE. Well if your staff were not stupid enough to enter my incorrect bank details there would be no problems !!!!! So now i have to close my business and wait for you to pull your fingers out of your asses to get the thousands of pounds in payments you owe me. Oh yes i have confirmation that it was an error from your company. UPDATE - So you call me yesterday at 16.30 to tell me you transferred money to my bank for me and it would be there in 2 hours, well it is now 10.32 Saturday morning and it still isn't there. Where the hell is my money ? UPDATE 04/03/19 Well today is Monday and still no sign of any money. Turns out you LIED and never transferred it at all WOW !!!! Try getting some staff who understand English for a start that would help you. This company is nothing but a scam. I'm starting to wonder if i'll see the money you owe me this side of Christmas.",

I have never seen anything as bad as Global Payments. \n\nThe company seems to be a disorganized collection of acquired companies. We signed up for a GP test account, and as we get deeper into the online documentation, the actual payment service involved is a 2015 acquisition called RealEx Payments. As we started writing test code, we had a few questions. Several phone calls later, I am told that the only support channel is through an email address. Fine. I sent email, waited several days, and received an adequate response. During this delay, I discovered several more issues. Their documentation is incomplete, and often simply incorrect -- what's written does not match the real-world requirements or results at all.  Worse yet, the API is full of gaping holes - basic functionality you would expect to find is absent.  When you ask them about it, they just stop responding.\n\nI've dealt with many payment processors over the years, so this is not completely unheard of, just the first of many \"red flags.\"  I end up calling Dublin Ireland, trying to track down the RealEx people, who are initially responsive and helpful in solving one problem (out of ten?).  As the number of problems begins to increase, though, they refer me to someone at another company in the US, Heartland. This guy is nice enough, but I'm still not getting answers. Turns out, he is relaying my questions back to Dublin!  So, I email them again. Almost a week later, I get a response that reads basically, \"read the documentation and xxck off.\" The message apparently being, \"what you see is what you get, and we're not going to help you.\"  Thanks.\n\nSo, I've wasted FOUR WEEKS doing what should have taken 4 days. Now we're pushing the whole thing back to the corporate client behind this project and we'll see what happens.  My recommendation is to avoid Global Payments at all costs.  It is definitely not worth the trouble.",

        "text": "Firstly we had an account with a merchant service called nochex who was then acquired and taken over a while later by global payments.\n\nWe are a fairly new online ecommerce business and was doing as expected with small growth patterns starting to build, when we where hit by fraud as global payments was accepting the payments taking their percentage out from each transaction and forwarding the money on to our selfs, we had no indication that we was actually accepting fraudulent payments. \n\nWe received an email from global payments stating that the account was now closed and we would no longer be allowed to take payments, it seems to keep costs down global payments call centres are in different countries with operators speaking very very poor English. After much confusion and being passed to numerous departments I was handed over to a lady by the name of Justine if I’m not mistaken who explained to me that they would not be reinstating the account and there was no way it was possible even If I was to pay back the fraudulent traction’s (chargebacks) basically the account was closed and that was that! I did explain I was offered no advice on the set up and how to prevent fraud and would it not be possible to set up a fraud flag management detector moving forward to prevent further fraud before the transaction takes place, the lady then advised me that the decision to close the account was actually hers and no one else’s. \n\nSo I was left, a new online ecommerce  business with no way of taking payments receiving letters from global payments instructing me that I would need to pay back all the chargebacks or the debt would be passed on to debt collection agency with added costs, I couldn’t believe this company was now threatening me with a recovery acency after I had agreed to pay back the sum they claimed was fraudulent. I contacted global payments again and explained that if the account could be reinstated and I could start taking payments  again and would then be in a position to set up some type of payment plan I was told this would not be possible  I explained without I payment gateway I had no business, no way of taking payments. \n\nThe decision was made to apply for other merchant accounts with a lot of companies approving only to inform me a short while later that the application was now declined with no reasons why, I then contacted global payments and spoke with Justine again who I explained my current situation and asked if I had been blacklisted somehow? As companies where  approving the business to inform me less than a week later that they would no longer be able to offer me a gateway. Justine informed that this was not the case it was solely up to the provider who they did and did not accept and if I wanted to appeal the closure of the account I would need to do so via email to which I did throughly explaining the situation and was told I could expect I response within 48 hours, weeks  went by with no response I rung  global payments and was told someone would contact me this has now been weeks with no response!!! \n\nToday is where this all fits in to place after months of no merchant account no sales 20+merchants declining the business. Their was hope that a merchant account had actually approved the business the relevant details where sent over to the web developer to integrate, things where finally looking up, a weight had been lifted I could now start taking payments and move forward with the business.  A thought that crossed my mind was that I would now be able to set up a payment plan with global payments and finally and put this whole situation behind me. The new provider was approved 5 days ago and was in the process of being Integrated the company emailed me today explaining that they where very sorry but they could not no longer provide an account and would have to shut the gateway down as the business was associated on MATCH a list of terminated merchants file operated by the card networks. \n\nI was the one affected by fraud I would be the one occurring the costs yet global payments treated me as if I was the fraudster!! I have not once refused to pay any sum owed (chargebacks) I have only ever tried to work with global payments to reach a civil outcome in the situation only to be treated with zero respect zero remorse zero customer skills zero service!!\n\nI have now as of recent been contacted by a debt recovery acency who have informed me they have taken over the debt in relation to global payments, so global payments could not reach any other type of outcome other than passing the debt on to a collection agency adding additional costs to situation I fiound myself in, global payments have dismembered my business apart and continue to do so.  \n\nGlobal payments a company who lie when asked if your company has been placed on some type of blacklist for merchant companies. \n\nGlobal payments a company with robotic like answers avoid at all costs!!",

This combination just adds to confusion and the feeling that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.\n\nI found it necessary to cancel my account as I decided to close my business premises and incurred hefty cancellation fees even with just a few months left until the end of my 18 month contract (£330). I accepted this as coming out of any contract prematurely has penalties. I paid the sum immediately and after asking if this was all that I owed to them I was advised that this was the end of the matter - oh no it wasn't! Global Payments sent me a disgraceful FINAL DEMAND letter for the princely sum of £14 and added that debt recovery agents would be used - with a whole page of the page and a half letter telling me what they would do with regards to recovering this outstanding amount. So much for customer service to a customer that had never defaulted always paid their fees on time and that had paid the cancellation notice promptly!\n\nI obviously questioned this final demand as a matter of principle. The reply I received was that when I closed my account I did so at the start of the month. Apparently Global Payments calculate their invoices in the middle of the month, therefore they were not aware that there was a charge for the previous month (February) when I paid the closing balance (in March). How was I supposed to know about this, after all the machine was unused in February. I paid the final balance in good faith that the account was now clear, and I like many do not like receiving threatening letters when I have acted decently and paid my dues.\n\nI find this totally unprofessional and time will tell if there is something else Global Payments will find that I owe them.",

You have admitted you owe me the money but for some unknown reason can't seem to send it back to me. I have wasted hours in calls and emails - why oh why is it so complicated to return MY money to me that you owe me.  If I owed you money you would debit it from my account without delay. Give me my money back!  Your business is payment processing - so process my refund.  It's an absolute farce.  Speak to DAVID COONEY who has been dealing with my complaint (or not dealing with it).",

Ms. Mc Dermot went out of her way to assist us and even went high up the line to fight for us.  Just cannot praise her efforts high enough. Ms. Mc Dermot truly put her customer first!  What more can any RealEx client ask for ? 10 out of 10 is well deserved here!",

One of my websites had an outage over the pre-Christmas sales, they don't seem to have a proper support ticketing system in place, consequently my request sank into the inbox of apathy. From my experience none of the staff are taught to care about the reputation of the company, they are only acting as individuals trying to win arguments. After working with them for 7 years they would not listen to my complaints. I tried to call a particular person for 6 months and every time I got the obvious 'he's in a meeting'. I never got called back. After a year of chasing at least an apology I finally found another person who would not accept responsibility for his colleagues actions.",

They absolutely will freeze your account often and hold your money you need to pay suppliers with hostage.  The messed up part is they cause you to get charge backs when they freeze your account out of the blue. Then they tell you the charge backs are your fault and your a high risk merchant. Again, they hold all your revenue every time they freeze your account.  Just stay the heck away from them.  Worst decision I have made with the company.

If you don't use who they direct you towards you will be charged £50 plus for not having it.\nonce you have got through the paperwork for that dont even bother trying to login using the same details to redo the compliance forms as they have \"lost them\".

The lady I dealt with couldn't even get the price right as first time she mentioned this fee she said £20 then it went up to £30 then down and then up again.\nWhen I pointed out that the contract for collection was between them and the courier company she agreed that it was, so they should be paying for it again agreeing.\nSo glad to be out of it all now.",

Beyond that he took into account the pressure we as a company were under to get our issue resolved and obviously took the personal decision that he would see us through this issue right to the end regardless of his actual working hours. \n\nThis was especially notable considering it was Friday 15th Dec, which would have been one of busiest periods for online purchases. Jason negotiated with other stakeholders/departments in Realex to ensure that our issue was dealt with by them so that he could take it from them and work with us on the solution. \n\nThis clearly shows his ability to be quick on his feet and to negotiate with others to achieve his targets, something extremely valuable in any organisation. Match that with his initiative and interpersonal skills and I think you must recogonise that Jason is a valuable asset to Realex Payments systems. \n\nIt is this kind of experience that would keep me coming back to you as a payment gateway.

        "text": "After calling around a few other processing companies (Payzone, Worldpay, First Data) it became immediately evident that we've been overcharged by Global Payments. We've been with them as long as we've been in business because they were the default choice offered by our bank HSBC. It's sickening to see how much money we've paid to them and how much we could potentially have saved over the last 8-9 years. On top of this their bills are complex and their online billing system for retrieving invoices is clunky and outdated. They also don't assist with PCI DSS compliance (unlike Payzone for example who manage everything on your behalf) and instead palm you off on to SecurityMetrics who are equally overpriced. After a lot of research we moved to Payzone who sent down a rep (none of the other processing companies bothered to do this) and highlighted various areas where we were spending unnecessarily. We've run the figures and are saving £2,319.48 annually in processing fees plus £1,200 in PCI DSS non compliance fees despite being compliant.\nThe smack in the face was that Global Payments were actually prepared to match Payzone's offer to keep our business but after realising how much they've ripped us off over the last 8-9 years there's no incentive whatsoever for us to continue using them. \nIn short, if you're looking for a processing partner then stay well clear of Global Payments. If you're already with Global Payments then give them notice you want out and find a company who treats you better and is far more competitive on price. My personal recommendation would be Payzone but World Pay were also very competitive. First Data were slow to respond to emails and didn't seem very interested in the business.",

Not only that, extra charges for this and charges for that with no clear explanation as to what the charges are for.  \nInterchange, Non Secure, PCI, Other Fees, Non Sterling Transaction Fees.....the list goes on!  \nDuring the 98 minute phone call (thankfully only about 5 mins of which I was on hold) I got transferred the \"Retention Team\" who did nothing to actually resolve any of my issues but instead offered to look at my rates and see if they could beat another card merchant's quotation that I'd recently had.....if I divulged the competitor's rates of course!     \n\nErr, no thanks.

However to link the payments with our bank we had to use Worldpay. This is where the problems started. After several hours of conversation with different people in different departments we still had no payment gateway setup. We had incorrect MIDs, bank accounts not linked and previous transactions that they had no reference to. We lost three days of internet business and the attitude of World pay was disgraceful. It has taken me the Project Manager and our Finance Director four weeks to finally get this resolved. Thankfully the support that we had from the Realex side and especially Eóin was exceptional.

The back-office system (Realcontrol) is very easy to use and modern - better than most back office systems.\n\nTheir pricing is very fair - you will struggle to find better value among European PSPs. Many other PSPs have hidden charges which quickly add up - account change fees, charging for additional services etc. They are partnered with a good range of acquirers, so you will be able to negotiate with a few acquirers to get a good deal - particularly true if you only require card charging.",

However working with Realex and specifically Daniel Jaffray, I managed to get it working with 3DSecure in no time. Daniels help and patience was the winning factor at the end of the day. I have been using Realex for nearly 7 years now and have multiple clients using their payments system through my e-commerce solutions. Thank you Realex.",

I contacted realex to request a list of all users on the realex system. As there had never been a review of the system done before between both accounts there were over 900 user ID’s to be deleted. I was also under time pressure to get this done by a deadline. I spoke with Daniel in realex many times during the review. We went back and forth with updated lists ensuring all deletions were completed correctly. Daniel was so helpful. He answered all of my queries big or small and was always quick to get back to me. I realise that my request was more than likely outside of Daniel’s remit but he was always professional and I felt like I could pick up the phone to him at any stage and he would investigate my query and get back to me as soon as he had an answer. I would just like to say thank you so much to Daniel and the team at realex for all your help with this audit and for making my job that bit easier, your help and understanding was much appreciated.",

Integrating payment gateways can difficult but thankfully I've never had any major problems with them and the process was relatively easy. They were always able to solve any issues I had which were usually minor. Their product offering is also ahead of the competition and good value so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to both merchants and developers!",

The emails and phone calls were regular and the consistency of the work flow to get the job done was great and quite rare these days! Nicholas even stayed late on the first day to check some code and settings with me in order to get the job done! Great to deal with and has encouraged me to offer this shopping cart service partnered with Realex's configuration and product solution to my existing and new clients; simply down to the support I received and the follow through in getting this implemented quickly and easily!Thanks again!",
